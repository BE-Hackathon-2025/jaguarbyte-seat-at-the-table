Seat at the Table

Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
* How might we help commuter students within the Atlanta University Center (AUC) access affordable, healthy meals despite limited time, kitchen access, and rising food costs?
* How might we use AI and community collaboration to reduce food waste while fostering connection and belonging among AUC commuters?
* How might we design a scalable, data-driven model for food equity that begins in the AUC and expands to HBCUs nationwide?

Project Description 🤯
Seat at the Table is an AI-powered platform that helps AUC commuter students share ingredients, cook together, and reduce food waste through community-driven meal matching. Students can post or join shared meals, pooling what they have to make affordable, balanced dishes. The platform uses AI to suggest meal ideas based on available ingredients, location, and dietary preferences, fostering collaboration and connection across campuses.

Project Value 💰
Seat at the Table improves food affordability and access for AUC commuters while giving schools and sponsors measurable insights into food security and engagement. It builds belonging, promotes sustainability, and empowers students to create shared solutions to everyday challenges. Designed to scale from the AUC to HBCUs nationwide, it represents a sustainable, tech-driven approach to campus community care.
